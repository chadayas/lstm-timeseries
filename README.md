## Introduction
In finance and banking, the 10-year Treasury bond yield is a benchmark measure of current demand for returns on capital. The US Government issues bonds to receive an 
injection of capital with the caveat of having to payback the bond holder the interest rate or yield on the amount of money borrowed.
The market rate determines the amount of interest paid plus the loan amount, which is paid at the maturity date. Savvy investors and sophisticated bankers use this measure to determine investor sentiment of market participants.

## Focus
Attempt to create Long Short-Term Memory Model to predict bond yields. This will be done with backtesting, in which we will not be predicting future prices, but instead try to approximate yields of more recent past yield rates. Purpose is to test for robustness of the LSTM model and to its feasibility of time-series forecasting.
