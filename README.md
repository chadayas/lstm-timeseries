## Introduction
In finance and banking, the 10-year Treasury bond yield is a benchmark measure of current demand for returns on capital. The US Government issues bonds to receive an 
injection of capital with the caveat of having to payback the bond holder the interest rate or yield on the amount of money borrowed.
The market rate determines the amount of interest paid plus the loan amount, which is paid at the maturity date. Savvy investors and sophisticated bankers use this measure to determine investor sentiment of market participants.
